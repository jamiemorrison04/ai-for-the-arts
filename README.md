# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio

GUID: 2777134

## Introduction

Hello, I am currently studying **Music** and **Digital Media** joint honours in my *third* year at university. I am excited to understand and learn further about AI, its human impact, and its use in society.

### Purpose of this Repository
Last semester I used GitHub to create a portfolio for another DMIS class: **Music Curation & Analytics**. Therefore this year I am excited to use it again to create another portfolio, this time for my class **AI for the Arts and Humanities**.

### Goals
1. Consolidate my learning and understanding of how to use GitHub
2. Consolidate my learning and understanding of how to use Python
3. How to effectively collaborate with others on a task

### Content
1. First notebook titled AI_A_Portfolio_2777134.ipynb containing most lab tasks done throughout the semester.
2. Second notebook titled Machine-Learning-by-Example-from-Start-to-End.ipynb containing task on machine learning by example and peer work.
3. A third notebook titled MusicMentor_LLM_Notebook.ipynb containing the last task of the Lab Book, where I present a design for a creative large-language-based model and its uses in relation to culture and society.
4. Lastly, other files can be found in my repository such as images, audio files, and licensing.
