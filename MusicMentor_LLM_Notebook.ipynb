    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Music Mentor* is a large language model-powered digital assistant designed to collaborate with musicians — from beginners to professionals — to inspire, guide, and co-create music. It helps users compose, explore music theory, generate lyrics, and connect musical ideas across genres and cultures.\n",

    "1. *Lyric Model:*\n",
    "- Generates and edits lyrics based on emotion, genre, theme, or style.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Composition Model:*\n",
    "- Assists with melody, harmony, and structure suggestions using symbolic or audio-based music generation (e.g., MIDI or notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Critique & Explain Model:*\n",
    "- Acts as a coach, giving theory explanations (e.g., “This chord progression modulates to the relative minor\") and offering feedback."

    "1. *For learners:* \n",
    "- Music students or people looking to music as a hobby may use this as a tool to assist their composition or theory skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *For Creators:*\n",
    "- Musicians/Songwriters looking for inspiration or co-writing support whether that be lyrcially or musically.\n",

    "3. *For Educators:*\n",
    "- *Music Mentor* is a great digital assistant that would be beneficial to students if integrated into the classroom environment."

    "\n",
    "1. *Notation software plugin (e.g., Sibelius or MuseScore):*\n",

    "\n",
    "3. *Mobile app with voice & text chat for quick music brainstorming on the go:*\n",
    "- Chatbot-like discussions where musicians may need quick help with generating lyrics, defining and understanding music definitions, or conversations about anything music related."

    "\n",
    "2. *Engagement*\n",
    "- Encourages creativity by offering “what if?” pathways (e.g., what if you turned this sad ballad into a major-key pop track?).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Acts like a non-judgmental musical partner, reducing fear of creative failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Inclusion*\n",
    "- Adapts to different learning styles: visual, aural, or verbal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can include prompts and explanations in multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps users with disabilities by supporting voice interaction and accessible music notation.\n"

    "1. *Positive Implications*\n",
    "- Wider access to music creation: lowers barriers for those without formal training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global music exposure: can suggest ideas from non-Western traditions, promoting cultural appreciation.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. *Potential Concerns*\n",
    "- Creativity commodification: Might discourage originality if users over-rely on AI-generated templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias in musical output: If trained mostly on Western datasets, it might underrepresent global genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replacement anxiety: Some may worry it replaces educators or composers — needs to be framed as a collaborator, not a substitute."
