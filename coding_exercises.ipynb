    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "1. variable = \"___\"\n",
    "2. Firstly, give the variable a name, then use the equals sign to assign the variable a value, and make sure to use either '' or \"\" to define this value.\n",
    "3. Once the variable has been assigned a value, we can combine this with the earlier print function to create something like: print(variable)\n",
    "4. Defining a variable can be very useful if you are going to be using that piece of code many times throughout a coding file. Reusability is key to coding as it cuts down characters and increases the codes readability.\n",
    "5. Variables should be assigned useful and descriptive names. If the variable you are assigning is someones first name for example, you could assign the variable the name firstName = \"___\"."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Functions\n",
    "1. def: the def function is used to define a new function\n",
    "2. def greeting: Secondly, naming the new function is very important, and like before, it is important to use a useful and descriptive name for your function. For example I have given the name 'greeting' as i am about to create a function that will give the output of a greeting.\n",
    "3. def greeting (): The brackets are used top define any parameters for the function. As this function doesn't have any parameters, it is left empty.\n",
    "4. Indented inside this function is whatever message you want printed. I will choose print (\"Hello there!\")\n",
    "5. Finally, you will call the function at the end like this: greeting(). This will display the message 'Hello there!'\n",
    "6. Creating functions can be very useful as it can tidy up many lines of code into one singular function. It can print or carry out many tasks, all under the one function, therefore only giving one execute command rather than several. It increases readability and is easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(5):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "1. for: This keyword is used to start a for loop.\n",
    "2. i: This is a loop variable that takes on a new value from the sequence on each iteration of the loop. You can name it anything you like, but i is commonly used.\n",
    "3. in: This keyword is used to specify the sequence to loop over.\n",
    "4. range(5): This function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (5 numbers in total). The loop will run once for each number in this sequence.\n",
    "5. :: The colon indicates the start of the loop's body.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. print(\"Hello, world!\"): This line is the body of the loop. It contains the code that will be executed on each iteration of the loop.\n"
